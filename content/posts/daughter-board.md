## Introduction

This is more of beach head than anything. The "Daughter Board" is very
complex and contains a considerable amount of the actual "CPU", so a
single post about it isn't really feasible. This should just serve as
more of a tour around the board itself, with pointers to the
individual parts in much more detail.

I'll also take this moment to share a fun note. One of the tenets I've
tried to adhere to in designing and building the Theoputer is to limit
outside help. It's not so much that I don't want/like help, but more a
way to see if I could figure things out on my own. I am, after all,
officially an "expert" of Computer Science and in my hubris have a
small inkling that I could discover something interesting because I
lack the curse of knowledge in this case.

So far, nothing novel. However! The name of this board is a funny
situation. When I was designing the earliest parts of the Theoputer I
knew that I need to work incrementally and modularly. The
[8Bit Register]({{< iref "register.md" >}}) and the [ALU]({{< iref
"alu.md" >}}) were two of the first boards I ever made, but I quickly
needed a way to connect them. I thought to myself:

    "Self. You have these little boards, like little daughters. Plug
    them into a larger board that contains them. Clearly called the
    Daughter Board!"

It took me a good year before it dawned on me that I had "re-invented"
the *Mother*board, but missed the now-obvious relationship between
daughters and mothers. Alas. I'll chalk it up to my own daughter not
having been born until after I coined the term.

## A Tour Around the Board

Here is the current version of the Daughter Board:

<kicanvas-embed
    src="/pcb/Daughter Assembly.V8-20250912.kicad_pcb"
    layers="Edge.Cuts, F.Fab, F.SilkS, Holes, Vias, F.Cu, B.Cu, Pads, F.Silkscreen"
    controls="basic+"></kicanvas-embed>

That's a lot, and it doesn't even really tell the full story, because
the entire point of (incorrectly) naming this thing a "daughter" board
is that there are other boards that plug into it! It's probably very
hard to even see the outlines of those boards from the complex viewer
above. So let's simplify things a bit and just look at the pieces:

<kicanvas-embed
    src="/pcb/Daughter Assembly.V8-20250912.kicad_pcb"
    layers="Edge.Cuts, F.Fab, F.SilkS, Holes, F.Silkscreen, Pads"
    controls="basic+"></kicanvas-embed>

This view just shows the outlines of the boards, the chips on the
Daughter Board, and a few pieces of information that will end up being
printed onto the printed circuit board during fabrication.

There are twelve sections we will look at briefly, with pointers to more
in-depth considerations:

1. Data Bus
1. Registers
1. Clock
1. Program Counter
1. ALU
1. Branch Control
1. Instruction and Control
1. I/O
1. Power
1. RAM
1. Stack Pointer
1. SD Card

Before we look at each of the sections, just take a mental note that
every single chip on the board has at least one 0.1uF capacitor right
next to its VCC pad. Some have an additional 1uF capacitor. These are
decoupling capacitors and are critical to ensuring the board is light
on [ground noise]({{< iref "ground-noise.md" >}}), which is a much
deeper concept worth reading about at your leisure.

### Data Bus

The data bus isn't really a section of the board because it is a group
of traces that go all over the board. Fundamental to the operation of
the Theoputer is the concept that data of any form is "put onto" and
"read from" a single group of 16 wires. By controlling which other
parts of the Theoputer are either reading or writing to/from these 16
wires we are able to perform nearly all of the operations of the
CPU. Here are those lines, ~~DBUS0~~ through ~~DBUS15~~, crossing the
board on the bottom layer (blue):

<kicanvas-embed
    initialZoom="15.993706037266339" initialX="92.68390870438668" initialY="67.25556307779696"
    src="/pcb/Daughter Assembly.V8-20250912.kicad_pcb"
    layers="Edge.Cuts, F.Fab, F.SilkS, Holes, F.Silkscreen, Pads, B.Cu, Vias"
    controls="basic+"></kicanvas-embed>

You can read more about what the data bus is and why it's important in
the [data bus post]({{< iref "databus.md" >}}), but for now just note
that it goes everywhere! Connecting up all the things that need to
speak to each other, and with 16bits of data. It's worth also noting
that the data bus is often considered as two separate buses, a "low"
8bit bus comprised of the lines ~~DBUS0~~ through ~~DBUS7~~ and a
"high" 8bit bus comprised of lines ~~DBUS8~~ through ~~DBUS15~~.

The only other thing worth mentioning here is that every connection
*to* the data bus has an electrical component called a buffer, and
ever connection *from* the data bus has another buffer. These buffers
are like electrically-controllable breakers, so that if the buffer is
disabled, it's as if there is a disconnected wire between the bus and
whatever is on the other side of the buffer. This ensures that only
one thing ever writes to the data bus at a time. That's important
because if there were a scenario where two things tried to drive the
data bus lines at the same time, we would have a phenomenon called bus
contention, and bus contention makes circuits very unstable.

### Registers

There are actually several "kinds" of registers on the Theoputer, but
this section is dedicated to the "CPU registers". If you've studied or
used other CPUs at a low level this concept will be
straightforward. If not, a register is a jargon-y word for a circuit
that can store a value indefinitely, until you decide you want to
store a different value. Very similar to "memory", but usually *much*
faster although in the Theoputer case the speed difference doesn't
currently matter.

The post about [Registers]({{< iref "register.md" >}}) contains a lot
of the details about how registers work on a low-level and how they
work at a high-level in the Theoputer. But for the tour, the main
takeaway is that there are four "general purpose" CPU registers, an
ALU register, and a CPU status register.

<kicanvas-embed
    initialZoom="8.062270948077959" initialX="74.74011838224975" initialY="44.36358206745628"
    src="/pcb/Daughter Assembly.V8-20250912.kicad_pcb"
    layers="Edge.Cuts, F.Fab, F.SilkS, Holes, F.Silkscreen, Pads"
    controls="basic+"></kicanvas-embed>

#### Registers A, B, Y, and Z

Registers A, B, Y, and Z are general purpose in the sense that they
are controllable by a programmer. You can write and read to these
registers freely, e.g. via the instruction ==LAI 0x3A== which Loads A
with an Immediate byte value \(\textrm{3A}_{16}\). Registers A and B
have been around in the Theoputer since its inception, while Y and Z
were added in version three.

The only notable difference between these registers is that Register B
is the only register that can address, and be addressed (as of V7+),
the upper eight data bus lines ~~DBUS8~~ through ~~DBUS15~~. This
ability is critical to certain instructions that need to read/write
the "high" byte on the data bus.


#### ALU Register: X

ALU operations produce 8bit values that are stored in Register X after
any ALU operation. Only the ALU can write to this special register,
but it can be read from "normally" in the sense that there is a read
signal (~~^XO^~~) that will cause the contents of Register X to be put
on the low byte of the data bus (i.e. lines ~~DBUS0~~ through
~~DBUS7~~). There is a little bit of extra gate logic to get this work
correctly:

<svg-viewer src="/img/daughter-board/Daughter Assembly.V8-20250912.svg" viewBoxX="231.40858850885093" viewBoxY="4.114708436376851" viewBoxWidth="208.6715548143096" viewBoxHeight="147.48091806451615">
</svg-viewer>

If you follow the logic you'll see that Register X is only written to
during an ALU operation (on the ~~â†‘CLK~~ signal as always) and can
only be read from onto the data bus low byte lines.

> Note: If the NOR gate with an inverted ~~^CLK^~~ signal as the
  ~~Cp~~ input signal on the register is unintuitive/confusing at
  first glance, checkout [Registers]({{< iref "register.md" >}}) to
  see the details for why that makes sense.

#### CPU Status Register

The CPU status register is similar to Register X in that it cannot be
written to by programmers, but can be read from. Its purpose is to,
well, contain information about the status of the CPU. At first that
might seem like a weird thing to need/do, but the kind of status that
it captures is critical to certain operations. Here's the schematic of
it:

<svg-viewer src="/img/daughter-board/Daughter Assembly.V8-20250912.svg" viewBoxX="4.4079200958406375" viewBoxY="2.781470489111899" viewBoxWidth="181.53652549243606" viewBoxHeight="128.30293743529896">
</svg-viewer>

You can see that it only captures three bits of data:

1. The state of the signal ~~ALU_OFLOW~~
1. The state of the signal ~~ALU_CARRY~~
1. The state of the signal ~~INT_0~~

It turns out that the last signal ~~INT_0~~ isn't even implemented so
it's only two bits! But those are critical bits of information,
containing the last status of the ALU since clearing the status
register via ~~^CR^~~. And those two bits are necessary to deal with
[ALU subtraction]({{< iref "alu-subtraction.md" >}}) and general
overflow conditions of the ALU.

> Note: Getting this simple register to work correctly has been a
  journey that I've not enjoyed at times. I went back and forth on
  ways to implement the ALU statuses, etc. that would avoid having a
  dedicated reset signal and instruction but eventually had to
  acquiesce because all my other strategies created breaking bugs.

### Clock

The clock is one of the three remaining boards that plug into the
Theoputer daughter board. You can see the outline of the most-recent
version of the clock in the daughter board here:

<kicanvas-embed
    src="/pcb/Daughter Assembly.V8-20250912.kicad_pcb"
    initialZoom="14.210625110171355" initialX="46.008702823473605" initialY="98.99863921570636"
    layers="Edge.Cuts, F.Fab, F.SilkS, Holes, F.Silkscreen"
    controls="basic+"></kicanvas-embed>

The clock itself is small but mighty. It's also one of the few
analog-like circuits in the entire computer, so while it is physically
small it's rather complex. There are several posts about how the clock
works, starting with an [overview]({{< iref "clock.md" >}}) of some
clock basics.

The interface to the clock board used to be very simple, consisting
only of the the ~~CLK~~ and ~~^CLK^~~ as output signals (180&deg; out
of phase) and ~~HLT~~ as an input signal.

To facilitate external controls of the clock speed and type (manual
step, adjustable, and built-in 1.8432MHz oscillator) there are now
some pins at the bottom of the board that connect to fancy
plugs/headers on the daugher board itself.

The only other thing worth noting here are the two resistors near the
top of the board, right by the ~~CLK~~ and ~~^CLK^~~ labels. These are
the transmission line source resistors we needed to add after
discovering that the clock lines were action like
[tranmission lines]({{< iref "transmission-line-reflections.md" >}}).


### Program Counter

The program counter is very crucial to the operation of the Theoputer
and almost every CPU out there. Maybe every CPU out there. Its job is
to keep track of where in the instruction list (program) the CPU
currently is located. So if you have a list of three instructions to
execute like:

```nasm
LAX
JPA
HLT
```

The program counter will start at 0, then increase to 1, and finally 2
before the ==HLT== instruction halts execution. This is a great time
to recall the role of the clock in the Theoputer. Its job is to cause
"the next thing to happen" and *one* of the ways the clock does that
is by advancing the program counter! It's not exactly that simple
because the clock also needs to advance the microcoder (see the
[Instruction and Control](#instruction-and-control) section for a bit
more on that).

The program counter isn't much more than a 16bit register (oh look!
another kind of register) with some special control lines to make it
easy to increment it by one and to set it to a specific value:

<svg-viewer src="/img/daughter-board/Daughter Assembly.V8-20250912-Program Counter.svg" viewBoxX="20.188345712329422" viewBoxY="15.769628649032782" viewBoxWidth="311.23583843108383" viewBoxHeight="220.1242072646957">
</svg-viewer>

Notably this is a 16bit register, comprised of four separate
"synchronous counters". There's more detail on this in the post about
the [Program Counter]({{< iref "program-counter.md" >}}), so for now
the most important thing to note is that there are two input control
signals: ~~PI~~, and ~~PS~~. (Note: ~~CLR~~ isn't currently
used). ~~PS~~ is set high whenever you want to perform a **P**rogram
counter **S**tep operation and ~~PI~~ is set high for a **P**rogram
counter **I**nput operation, which uses all 16 ~~DBUS~~ lines to set
the program counter.

To give a brief preview of how this typically works, consider the
prior three instructions again:

```nasm
LAX
JPA
HLT
```

While there is no actual microcoder assembly language, we could look
at these three instructions in a fake microcoder language as:

```nasm
;; LAX (PC = 0)
XO, AI
PS
;; JPA (PC = 1)
AO, PI
;; HLT (PC = RegA)
HLT
```

You can see from above that after many instructions we set the ~~PS~~
signal active indicating to the CPU to go to the next instruction in
order. However, jump-like operations directly set the program counter
to indicate to the CPU that the next instruction is at a specific
address. In the contrived case above you'll have to put on your
imagination creation hat and assume that the contents of Register X
were 2.

### I/O

Even on the first fully-assembled Theoputer there was I/O! That may
seem like an overreach, but how else can you expect to speak to the
rest of the world without some I/O. The I/O system has also moved
around the most, but is currently nestled in the top left part of the
board:

<kicanvas-embed
    src="/pcb/Daughter Assembly.V8-20250912.kicad_pcb"
    initialZoom="11.178473634832965" initialX="30.50084378374209" initialY="49.326139918727655"
    layers="Edge.Cuts, F.Fab, F.SilkS, Holes, Pads, F.Silkscreen"
    controls="basic+"></kicanvas-embed>

That is both the set of chips that make the I/O go and the actual
plug/headers/port itself. Hey look! Another register:

<svg-viewer src="/img/daughter-board/Daughter Assembly.V8-20250912.svg" viewBoxX="112.0089751341146" viewBoxY="262.64698137425654" viewBoxWidth="202.8946179884302" viewBoxHeight="143.4989529744207">
</svg-viewer>

The I/O interface is a bit complicated. There is a fairly intricate
dance that has to take place to ensure that only I (input) or O
(output) is happening at one time and to ensure that data that is
outbound stays valid long enough for whatever is outside the CPU to
read it. There's also a bit of signaling that is available to I/O
devices that tells them when it's safe to read/write to help
coordinate everything. As usual, the post about the
[I/O Interface]({{< iref "io-interface.md" >}}) is a better place to
learn the details.

At a high level the I/O interface is intended to "look" like another
register to the CPU. All of those gates and that register are there to
give the illusion that this is just like Register A. Of course that's
not true and if the I/O device is quite slow then it will not operate
timing-wise like Register A, but reading/writing does work exactly the
same way. As you can see there are the usual ~~DBUS0~~ through
~~DBUS7~~ data bus lines, a couple buffers to ensure only input or
output is happening, and there is a register to hold on to the output
data until another output operation (via ~~^QI^~~) is encountered.

### ALU

If there is a "brain" of the CPU then it's probably safe to say that's
the [Arithmetic Logic Unit]({{< iref "alu.md" >}}) (ALU). Typically if
you're using a computer you want it to *compute* something and
typically that computation will involve an operation handled by the
ALU. Here are things that the Theoputer currently can compute:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Bit Shift (Left and Right)
- Bitwise AND
- Bitwise XOR

All of the operations work on 8bit inputs, which as usual come from
the ~~DBUS~~ lines.

On this grand tour of the daughter board, the ALU is one of the more
special stops because it is one of the few remaining actual boards
that is plugged in to the daughter board. You can see the headers
where that happens in the top right corner of the daughter board:

<kicanvas-embed
    src="/pcb/Daughter Assembly.V8-20250912.kicad_pcb"
    initialZoom="9.914416718037241" initialX="148.51761323037863" initialY="44.219222007464815"
    layers="Edge.Cuts, F.SilkS, Holes, F.Silkscreen"
    controls="basic+"></kicanvas-embed>

Here you can see the two input bytes labeled A0 - A7 and B0 - B7. The
signals connected to these inputs are ~~DBUS0~~-~~DBUS7~~ and
~~DBUS8~~-~~DBUS15~~ respectively. Here you can see that we are using
the 16bit-wide data bus to our advantage so that we don't need to
individually load each byte to operate on before performing the
operation. That decision comes at a cost though because it means two
things:

1. We need to support 16 data buses, which is more lines to manage
1. We need to have some way to read/write to the bottom/top bytes of
the data bus independently

That last point is why [Register B](#registers-a-b-y-and-z) has the
special property that it can read/write from/to the
~~DBUS8~~-~~DBUS15~~ lines.

Also noteworthy about the ALU interface are the X0 - X7
connections. Recall that there is a special ALU output register
([Register X](#alu-register-x)) that holds on to the last ALU
operation. Those X lines connect to that register, which itself is
actually on the daughter board not on the ALU board:

<kicanvas-embed
    src="/pcb/Daughter Assembly.V8-20250912.kicad_pcb"
    initialZoom="9.914416718037241" initialX="126.73115759279911" initialY="43.311453022565715"
    layers="Edge.Cuts, F.SilkS, Holes, Pads, F.Fab, F.Silkscreen, F.Cu:0.5, Vias, B.Cu:0.5"
    controls="basic+"></kicanvas-embed>

It's a bit challenging to follow the traces but you should see that
the X outputs from the ALU board connect to the REG X block.

### Branch Control

At first it may seem odd to have a section dedicated to branch
control, but it turns out that supporting branches isn't as trivial as
just reusing other parts of the Theoputer. If you're familiar with
modern CPU architectures you may be inclined to think that this
section has something to do with branch *prediction*, but it does not!
That is a much more complex feature of CPUs that is important only
when dealing with super scalar architecture, and the Theoputer is a
regular old scalar CPU as discussed in the post about the [Clock]({{<
iref "clock.md#tik-tok-goes-the-little-clock" >}}).

On the most-recent versions of the daughter board the branch control
logic isn't labeled, but it is all grouped in the same area under the
Clock board:

<kicanvas-embed
    src="/pcb/Daughter Assembly.V8-20250912.kicad_pcb"
    initialZoom="18.61541371702186" initialX="50.66787517387787" initialY="102.18780716777998"
    layers="Edge.Cuts, F.Fab, F.SilkS, Holes, Pads, F.Silkscreen"
    controls="basic+"></kicanvas-embed>

That's not very instructive on how the branch control works, so let's
look at the schematic:

<svg-viewer
    src="/img/daughter-board/Daughter Assembly.V8-20250912-BranchControl.svg"
    viewBoxX="6.398861377261755" viewBoxY="5.041999844113352" viewBoxWidth="286.6986756191594" viewBoxHeight="202.82406307100106"
    >
</svg-viewer>

Here we see there is a regster (ahoy there!), connected to a chip that
outputs if that register contains zero, and a few inputs:

- ~~OP0~~ and ~~OP1~~ which control the type of branching as a 2bit number:
  - 1: X == 0
  - 2: X >= 0
  - 3: x < 0
- ~~X0~~ through ~~X7~~ which is labeled vestigially incorrect and
  actually connects to ~~DBUS0~~ through ~~DBUS7~~
- ~~PI~~ which you may recall from the
  [Program Counter](#program-counter) section and is a control signal
  dictating that the CPU should set the program counter to the value
  on the ~~DBUS~~ lines.

There are some oddities you may note in the list above. For specifics,
refer to the more in-depth post on the [Branch Control]({{< iref
"branch-control.md" >}}).

### Instruction and Control

This one is a douzy (spelling?). It's by far the most complex section
of the Theoputer save for maybe the daughter board itself. There are
several posts about this section, which is actually one of the three
remaining plug-in boards to the daughter board. Start off on the
introduction post about the [Instruction and Control]({{< iref
"instruction-and-control.md" >}}) board to go deep on that.

For now, we can see how the Instuction and Control (I&C) board
interfaces with the daughter board and thus the rest of the Theoputer:

<kicanvas-embed
    src="/pcb/Daughter Assembly.V8-20250912.kicad_pcb"
    initialZoom="6.449418243960037" initialX="120.00951593010316" initialY="116.25046143185311"
    layers="Edge.Cuts, F.SilkS, Holes, F.Silkscreen"
    controls="basic+"></kicanvas-embed>

That large outline is where the I&C board plugs in, and has you can
(hopefully) see, there are six separate headers each of which is
16pins! That's a lotta pins. Not every pin is used, although most
are. At this small 1.27m pitch (distance between pins) it's far easier
to source the correct headers when they're all the same length. They
are, somewhat unfortunately, too small to get strong-enough pins that
can be broken to the correct length.

Let's look at the schematic here too because this is another case
where that's helpful:

<svg-viewer
    viewBoxX="121.7942001579821" viewBoxY="96.41435042113991" viewBoxWidth="215.3767254432108" viewBoxHeight="152.32703017249284"
    src="/img/daughter-board/Daughter Assembly.V8-20250912.svg">
</svg-viewer>

That certainly is easier to see, but that's still a lot of lines!
Let's just go over some of the big groups:

- ~~PC0~~ through ~~PC15~~: The 16bit program counter value as an *input*
- ~~INST0~~ through ~~INST15~~: The 16bit wide instruction *input*
- ~~IR0~~ through ~~IR11~~: The instruction register (oh haiii)
*output* connected to the bottom 12bits of the ~~DBUS~~ lines
- A bunch of control lines like ~~^AI^~~ and ~~^AO^~~ that are used
  to control register input/output modes respectively.
- ~~^CR^~~: Used to reset the
  [CPU Status Register](#cpu-status-register) to 0
- ~~^SO^~~, ~~^SI^~~, ~~^SP_DECR^~~, and ~~^SP_INCR^~~: Used to
  control/use the [stack pointer](#stack-pointer) via an output
  signal, input signal, and an increment or decrement signal
  respectively.
- ~~BO_HI~~: Used to control [Register B's]() read/write to the high
  data bus byte on ~~DBUS8~~ through ~~DBUS15~~ versus the usual lower
  byte on ~~DBUS0~~ through ~~DBUS7~~.
- ~~RS~~: The global reset signal, intended to be used by various
  systems to reset themselves to the "start" of execution.
- ~~J0~~ and ~~J1~~: Connected to the ~~OP0~~ and ~~OP1~~ of the
  [branch control](#branch-control) system to choose which kind of
  branching operation to perform.
- ~~HL~~: The global halt signal, which stops the clock output
  effectively halting the system.
- ~~^MA^~~: Used to control whether the [memory](#ram) address
  register should be read from ~~DBUS~~.
- ~~PI~~: Used to control whether the program counter should be set
  from the ~~DBUS~~ lines.
- ~~PS~~: Used to control whether the pgoram counter should be
  incremented (stepped).
- ~~ALU0~~ through ~~ALU3~~: Used to control which [ALU](#alu)
  operation should be performed.
- ~~STEP~~: An *output* from the I&C board indicating that on the next
  ~~â†“CLK~~ there will be a step-like operation (i.e. the program
  counter will change).
- ~~EXEC_MODE_RAM~~: An *output* signal that indicates whether instructions
  should be fetched and executed from RAM (high) or from ROM (low).
- ~~^ROM^~~: An *input* signal that allows the other Theoputer systems
  to indicate that the I&C board should enable (low) or disable (high)
  the ROM chips.

Phew. That's a lot. Probably enough for this entire section, so let's
leave it at that for now and if you want to read more of the details
check out that beach head post on the [Instruction and Control]({{<
iref "instruction-and-control.md" >}}) board.

### Power

Providing power should be easier right? Haha! Think again. Nothing's
easy in the land of electrons! Well it *can* be easy and in fact for
many versions was just a USB-C port connected directly to the main
~~VCC~~ power line. That changed between V6 and V7 whereupon the power
system got an upgrade to be more robust:

    src="/pcb/Daughter Assembly.V8-20250912.kicad_pcb"
    initialZoom="10.474983933423788" initialX="28.02231950155481" initialY="125.06475900722437"

    controls="basic+"></kicanvas-embed>

There's fairly clearly an ON/OFF switch and a USB-C port at the
bottom. But in between those two components is a bunch of capacitors
(to help with power delivery during high-load spikes) and a chip
that's hard to see in the board view, but easier to see in the
schematic:

<svg-viewer
    viewBoxX="331.73271162830054" viewBoxY="167.82024459806897" viewBoxWidth="139.013930651118" viewBoxHeight="98.31879078444405"
    src="/img/daughter-board/Daughter Assembly.V8-20250912.svg">
</svg-viewer>

That chip is the NCP380HSN05AAT1G, which is a power switch used very
frequently in USB hubs. In this case, the specific chip has a fixed
output current of 0.5A, which is currently (pun intended) enough for
the Theoputer. Notably, this chip does **not** handle the USB 3.*
(which is synonymous with USB-C) power negotiation protocol, so it has
to be plugged in to a USB-A port on the providing end.

### RAM

Originally RAM was only used in the Theoputer as a place where
programs could store and retrieve data to/from. Much like the
computers of yore it became clear, eventually, that using RAM to also
be able to store *instructions* was a game changer. At that moment,
the RAM system became a lot more complicated.

It's hard to show on the board where RAM is nowadays with this added
complexity, but it's roughly here:

<kicanvas-embed
    src="/pcb/Daughter Assembly.V8-20250912.kicad_pcb"
    initialZoom="10.600893512329407" initialX="101.30322649715573" initialY="110.3255754571179"
    layers="Edge.Cuts, F.Fab, F.SilkS, Holes, F.Silkscreen, F.Cu:0.5, Vias:0.5, B.Cu:0.5, Pads"
    controls="basic+"></kicanvas-embed>

Without diving into the internals of how the RAM system works (that
you can find in the dedicated [RAM]({{< iref "ram.md" >}}) post),
here's the schematic of the daugher board interface to it:

<svg-viewer
    viewBoxX="428.2962528796617" viewBoxY="226.01953853672882" viewBoxWidth="185.51462935076557" viewBoxHeight="131.20680744124337"
    src="/img/daughter-board/Daughter Assembly.V8-20250912.svg">
</svg-viewer>

The gates and the JK flip-flop are there to help coordinate the
handoff between executing instructions from ROM (the default) to
executing them from RAM. There is a dedicated post to that upgrade as
well, describing how the Theoputer [executes RAM instructions]({{<
iref "ram-instructions.md" >}}).

For now the important things to note are that there are a set of
control lines that determine whether RAM should output its contents to
the ~~INST{0-15}~~ instruction bus (~~^ROM^~~, ~~EXEC_MODE_RAM~~, and
~~STEP~~) and there are a set of control lines for the memory itself
to control the address to operate on (~~^MA^~~) and whether the
operation is an input (~~^MI^~~) or an output (~~^MO^~~).

### Stack Pointer

This is one of those sections that you learn about in some course
about programming or assembly or computer architecture. Assuming
you've gone through the pedagogy, the idea of a stack pointer (or at
least a "stack") will not be foreign. But does it make sense *why*
this is important? The earlier versions of the Theoputer didn't have a
dedicated stack pointer and they worked just fine. Well fine enough.

But without a dedicated stack pointer, you would inevitably discover
why dedicated stack pointers are *incredibly* useful. There are, of
course, more details in the post about the Theoputer
[Stack Pointer]({{< iref "stack-pointer.ms" >}}), so you'll have to
convince yourself or read that post to understand why the Theoputer
dedicates a fairly sizeable portion of the board to it:

<kicanvas-embed
    src="/pcb/Daughter Assembly.V8-20250912.kicad_pcb"
    initialZoom="16.928353398187834" initialX="156.77955661811274" initialY="129.43455384905445"
    layers="Edge.Cuts, F.Fab, F.SilkS, Holes, F.Silkscreen, F.Cu:0.5, Vias:0.5, B.Cu:0.5, Pads"
    controls="basic+"></kicanvas-embed>

In the section describing the
[Instruction and Control signals](#instruction-and-control) there are
details about the signals that control the stack pointer, but here
they are again for posterity:

- ~~^SO^~~, ~~^SI^~~, ~~^SP_DECR^~~, and ~~^SP_INCR^~~: Used to
  control/use the stack pointer via an output signal, input signal,
  and an increment or decrement signal respectively.

### SD Card

This is the newest part of the Theoputer and it's not even be
validated as working as of writing this! SD Cards have their own
protocols (some of which are now proprietary) and all of which operate
at voltage levels below the Theoputer's 5V. So much of the SD Card
area is occupied by power regulation:

<kicanvas-embed
    src="/pcb/Daughter Assembly.V8-20250912.kicad_pcb"
    initialZoom="16.346109729612404" initialX="164.85722811472618" initialY="37.96589742207243"
    layers="Edge.Cuts, F.Fab, F.SilkS, Holes, F.Silkscreen, F.Cu:0.5, Vias:0.5, B.Cu:0.5, Pads"
    controls="basic+"></kicanvas-embed>

Once again that's likely hard to understand, and once again there is a
dedicated post about the [SD Card Interface]({{< iref
"sd-card-interface.md" >}}) and once again the schematic is
potentially more useful:

<svg-viewer
    viewBoxX="277.9115348334778" viewBoxY="257.37718711989106" viewBoxWidth="209.04252780809765" viewBoxHeight="147.8471147484986"
    src="/img/daughter-board/Daughter Assembly.V8-20250912.svg">
</svg-viewer>

Here we see the voltage regulator (MIC5504-3.3YM5) responsible for
converting the 5V VCC power rail into a stable (we hope) 3.3V needed
by the SD Card Protocol. There are also several capacitors to help
with current spikes, which are fairly likely in this case when the
card is inserted.

Apart from that the SD Card interface works very similarly to the
generic [I/O Interface](#io), with a register (howdy there!) for
keeping output data valid for as long as we need and a buffer to the
~~DBUS~~ lines to handle bus contention.

One unique thing about the SD Card Protocol is that it is actually a
*serial* protocol. That's actually a lot more common for peripheral
protocols in computers than a *parallel* protocol, but the Theoputer
is more of a parallel-leaning entity. This because of the 8bit nature
of the computer. We always want to operate on 8bits at a time, which
is similar to saying we want to work on 8bits in parallel. In some
cases we even use 16bits (e.g. the [memory address register](#ram))
but we certianly don't send one bit a time between parts of the
system.

There are a number of ways to convert parallel-like signals into
serial-like signals. In the case of the SD Card interface we are using
one of the simplest: just use a single bit at a time!. That's why
there input to the first bit of the register (~~D0~~) is ~~DBUS0~~,
which in turn is connected to ~~SD_SPI_MOSI~~ - the SD Card serial
input line.

You'll notice four additional lines coming out of the Theoputer and
into the SD Card:

- ~~SD_SPI_CLK~~: Used as the clocking signal for the SD Card and any
  other SPI-compatible peripheral that's connected to the Theoputer.
- ~~SD_SPI_CS~~: Used to indicate to the SD Card that it is the
  peripheral that should read the serial data (~~SD_SPI_MOSI~~) and
  serial clock (~~SD_SPI_CLK~~) lines.
- ~~SPI_CS1~~: Used to indicate to a second SPI-compatible peripheral
  that it should handle the serial data and serial clock lines.
- ~~SPI_CS2~~: Used to indicate to a third SPI-compatible peripheral
  that it should handle the serial data and serial clock lines.

You may see something interesting in the information above. In the
Theoputer, SD Cards are communicated to via something called the
Serial Peripheral Interface protocol. This is a fairly standard
protocol that many peripherals use and the Theoputer has some extra
headers and pins to allow for other SPI peripherals to be connected.

Finally, there are some lines coming out of the SD Card and into the
Theoputer:

- ~~SD_SPI_CS~~: Same signal as above, just as a helpful output to the computer.
- ~~SD_SPI_CLK~~: Same signal as above, just as a helpful output to the computer.
- ~~SD_SPI_MISO~~: The serial data line out from the SD card (or any other
  connected SPI peripheral) and into the Theoputer
- ~~SD_DAT1~~: SD Card signal line that is used for advanced
  operations currently not implemented.
- ~~SD_DAT2~~: SD Card signal line that is used for advanced
  operations currently not implemented.
- ~~SD_CD_B~~: A signal coming from the physical SD Card slot that asserts
  high when an SD Card is inserted.

## Wrap-Up

Phew! That was a lot of information. This post will probably serve as
more of a reference (to me) than anything. It seems like there enough
detail to sort of understand what's going on, but not nearly enough
detail to put it all together into a cohesive understanding.

If nothing else it was helpful to organize my own thoughts about the
different systems in the computer, so there's always that!
