## Welcome

Welcome indeed. Here is a part journal, part conduit for my thoughts,
part (hopeful) inspiration to others, and part reference for
posterity.

This *Theoputer* started in my head decades ago. That is wild to
consider, but I have evidence from backups of old computers that at
least by 2001 I was researching logic gates for the purposes of
building a "computer" from scratch.

That idea lay dormant, somewhat, in my head for a very long while. I
tried several times to pick up the thread, but each time I was
thwarted by something. The first time around, frankly, I don't think I
had the engineering talent necessary to really put this all together
without significant help. I also didn't really have any help.

The second time I tried, during undergraduate, I lacked the discipline
to stick with the work. I also still likely lacked enough engineering
and scientific rigor, but it's hard to say for sure.

The third time was in 2022. At this point I had developed a strong
foundation of engineering and scientific rigor, but I quickly found
that I lacked the right mindset and the necessary income to make a lot
of mistakes. And let me assure you that I made and continue to make
**a lot** of mistakes.

So here we are. Round four. Started in roughly late January of
2024. Though to be fair we *are* is in fact December of 2024. I am
only recently started on the slightly tangential path of writing about
what I've been building nearly 12 months after starting!

Nevertheless, welcome all the same. I expect very little from writing
this up as I expect very little from building my little
Theoputer. This has been a sort of "bucket list" desire and through
the encouraging and kind words of some people in my life who have seen
the results of my efforts I have decided to document it all.
